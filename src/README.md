Nikhil's Portfolio Website
Video Demo: https://youtu.be/bkLnDw-jBkw


Description:
This project is a personal portfolio website mainly crafted to showcase my expertise in UI design, graphic art, and 3D modeling. The website will be useful as an engaging and professional platform to demonstrate my creative skills, connect with potential clients/ commissions, and offer services tailored to meet many people’s needs. By creating a portfolio website to show everyone what I can do and encourage them to hire me, I empower customers and/ or businesses to bring their ideas to life and pursue their projects with my services.
The entire website is built using React, a UI Framework that enables a dynamic, responsive, and seamless user experience. My goal is to present a mirage of my professional journey while emphasizing the quality and variety of my work. The website combines appealing visuals with functionality, ensuring an intuitive and inspiring experience for viewers.
